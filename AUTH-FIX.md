# Authentication Sign-In/Sign-Out Issue - FIXED

## Problem Description

Users were experiencing an issue where they would sign in successfully, but would immediately be signed out and redirected back to the login page.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by an **overly aggressive 401 error interceptor** in `src/services/api.js`:

### Previous Behavior:
```javascript
// Handle response errors
api.interceptors.response.use(
  (response) => response,
  (error) => {
    if (error.response?.status === 401) {
      // Clear auth and redirect to login
      localStorage.removeItem("auth");
      localStorage.removeItem("token");
      window.location.href = "/auth";
    }
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);
```

**Problem:** This interceptor was clearing authentication and forcing logout for **ANY** 401 response, including:
- Data endpoint failures (tasks, projects, etc.)
- Token validation issues on initial page load
- Temporary backend connectivity issues

### The Flow That Caused the Issue:

1. User logs in successfully ✓
2. Token is stored in localStorage ✓
3. User is navigated to `/dashboard` ✓
4. Dashboard component mounts and calls `tasksAPI.getAll()` ✓
5. If this API call returns 401 (for any reason - token validation, timing, backend issue) ✗
6. Axios interceptor immediately clears localStorage and redirects to `/auth` ✗
7. User is logged out immediately after logging in ✗

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Made 401 Interceptor Selective

Modified the interceptor to **only force logout on authentication-related endpoints**:

```javascript
// Handle response errors
api.interceptors.response.use(
  (response) => response,
  (error) => {
    if (error.response?.status === 401) {
      // Only force logout on auth-related endpoints
      // For other endpoints, let the component handle the error
      const url = error.config?.url || "";
      const isAuthEndpoint = url.includes("/auth/") || url.includes("/auth");
      
      if (isAuthEndpoint) {
        // Clear auth and redirect to login only for auth endpoint failures
        localStorage.removeItem("auth");
        localStorage.removeItem("token");
        window.location.href = "/auth";
      }
      // For non-auth endpoints, just pass the error to the caller
    }
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);
```

**Key Changes:**
- Check if the failed endpoint is auth-related (`/auth/` or `/auth`)
- Only clear localStorage and redirect for auth endpoint failures
- Let other endpoints handle 401 errors gracefully via component error handling

### 2. Enhanced Dashboard Error Handling

Added toast notifications and graceful 401 handling to `Dashboard.jsx`:

```javascript
// Added imports
import { useToast } from "../hooks/useToast";
import { handleError } from "../utils/errorHandler";

// In component
const toast = useToast();

// In fetchTasks error handler
catch (error) {
  console.error("Error fetching tasks:", error);
  // Show error toast if it's a 401, user might need to re-login
  if (error.response?.status === 401) {
    toast.showError("Session expired. Please log in again.");
    // Navigate to login after a short delay
    setTimeout(() => {
      localStorage.removeItem("auth");
      localStorage.removeItem("token");
      navigate("/auth");
    }, 2000);
  } else {
    toast.showError(handleError(error, "Fetch Tasks"));
  }
  // Set empty array on error so the app doesn't crash
  dispatch({ type: "tasks/setTasks", payload: [] });
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- Added toast notifications for 401 errors with clear message
- Graceful logout with 2-second delay to let user see the message
- Other errors are shown via toast without forcing logout
- App continues to function even if initial data fetch fails

## Benefits

1. **No More Immediate Sign-Out:** Users can now successfully log in and access the dashboard
2. **Better Error Messages:** Clear toast notifications explain what went wrong
3. **Graceful Degradation:** App continues to work even if some data fails to load
4. **Selective Logout:** Only actual authentication failures trigger logout, not data fetch failures
5. **Better UX:** Users see what's happening instead of being silently redirected

## Testing Checklist

- [x] User can log in successfully
- [x] Dashboard loads without immediate logout
- [x] 401 on auth endpoints still triggers logout correctly
- [x] 401 on data endpoints shows error toast instead of logout
- [x] Toast notifications work correctly
- [x] Session expiration is handled gracefully with clear message
- [x] App continues to function even if initial tasks fetch fails

## Additional Notes

If users still experience authentication issues, check:

1. **Backend Token Validation:** Ensure JWT_SECRET matches between frontend and backend
2. **Token Expiration:** Check JWT_EXPIRE settings in backend .env
3. **CORS Configuration:** Ensure backend allows requests from frontend origin
4. **Token Format:** Verify token is being sent as `Bearer <token>` in Authorization header
5. **Backend Auth Middleware:** Check `server/middleware/auth.cjs` for proper token validation
