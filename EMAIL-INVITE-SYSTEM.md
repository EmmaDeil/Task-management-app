## How It Works

### 1. Admin Creates Invitation

```
Admin → Invite Member Form
  ↓
Enters: email + role
  ↓
Backend generates unique invite code

Returns link for manual sharing (backup)
```

### 2. User Receives Email

The invited user receives a beautifully formatted email with:
- Organization name
- Role assignment (Admin/Manager/Member)
- "Accept Invitation & Sign Up" button
- Direct link to signup page
- Expiration notice (7 days)

### 3. User Clicks Link

```
Email Link: https://yourapp.com/auth?invite=abc123xyz
  ↓
Frontend validates invite code
  ↓
Shows pre-filled signup form with:
  - Email (read-only)
  - Organization name
  - Role badge
  ↓
User enters name + password
  ↓
Account created automatically
  ↓
Logs in and redirects to dashboard
```

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Configure Email Service

Edit `server/.env` with your email provider settings:

#### Option A: Gmail (Recommended for Testing)

```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM="TaskFlow <noreply@taskflow.com>"
```

**Important:** Use an App Password, not your regular Gmail password!

To get a Gmail App Password:
1. Go to Google Account → Security
2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication
3. Go to App Passwords
4. Create new app password for "Mail"
5. Copy the 16-character password
6. Use it in `EMAIL_PASS`

#### Option B: SendGrid (Recommended for Production)

```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=apikey
EMAIL_PASS=your-sendgrid-api-key
EMAIL_FROM="TaskFlow <noreply@yourdomain.com>"
```

#### Option C: Mailgun

```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.mailgun.org
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-mailgun-smtp-username
EMAIL_PASS=your-mailgun-smtp-password
EMAIL_FROM="TaskFlow <noreply@yourdomain.com>"
```

#### Option D: AWS SES

```env
EMAIL_HOST=email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-aws-ses-smtp-username
EMAIL_PASS=your-aws-ses-smtp-password
EMAIL_FROM="TaskFlow <noreply@yourdomain.com>"
```

#### Option E: Mailtrap (Testing Only)

```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
EMAIL_PORT=2525
EMAIL_USER=your-mailtrap-username
EMAIL_PASS=your-mailtrap-password
EMAIL_FROM="TaskFlow <noreply@taskflow.com>"
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install nodemailer
```

Already done! ✅

### Step 3: Restart Backend

```bash
cd server
node server.cjs
```

### Step 4: Test the System

1. **Login as Admin**
2. **Click "Invite Member"**
3. **Enter email and role**
4. **Check the invited user's email**

### Email Already Exists

## Testing Without Email

If you don't want to set up email yet, the system still works:

1. Create invitation as admin
2. Copy the generated link manually
3. Share link with invitee
4. Invitee clicks link and signs up
5. Works exactly the same!

**Email is optional but recommended for production.**

## Security Features

- Single-use (deleted after signup)
- 7-day expiration
- Stored server-side

### Email Validation
- Verify invite exists
- Check expiration
- Validate organization
- Prevent duplicate signups

### No Password in Email
- Never send passwords via email
- User creates their own password
- Meets security best practices

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/invites/create
Creates invitation and sends email

**Request:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "role": "member"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Invitation created successfully",
  "inviteCode": "abc123xyz...",
  "inviteLink": "https://app.com/auth?invite=abc123xyz",
  "expiresAt": "2025-10-14T...",
  "emailSent": true,
  "emailInfo": "Invitation email sent successfully"
}
```

### GET /api/invites/validate/:code
Validates invitation code

**Response:**
```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "role": "member",
  "organization": {
    "id": "org123",
    "name": "Acme Corp",
    "domain": "acme"
  }

    "role": "member",
    "organization": { ... }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending

**Check:**
1. `.env` file has correct email settings
2. `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_USER`, `EMAIL_PASS` are set
3. Backend restarted after changing `.env`
4. Check backend console for error messages
5. For Gmail: Using App Password (not regular password)
6. Firewall allowing SMTP connections

**Test:**
```bash
# Check backend logs
node server/server.cjs
# Look for: "Invitation email sent to user@example.com"
# Or: "Email not configured. Emails will not be sent."
```

### Invalid Invite Link

**Causes:**
- Invitation expired (>7 days old)
- Invitation already used
- Typo in invite code
- Backend restarted (in-memory invites cleared)

**Solution:**
- Admin creates new invitation
- For production: Move to MongoDB-based invites

### Email Goes to Spam

**Solutions:**
- Use verified email service (SendGrid, Mailgun)
- Set up SPF/DKIM records
- Use professional FROM address
- Include unsubscribe link (production)

## Production Recommendations

### 1. Use Professional Email Service
Don't use Gmail in production! Use:
- **SendGrid** - 100 emails/day free
- **Mailgun** - 5,000 emails/month free
- **AWS SES** - Very cheap, reliable
- **Postmark** - Excellent deliverability

### 2. Persist Invitations to Database
Current: In-memory (lost on restart)
Recommended: MongoDB model

```javascript
const invitationSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  code: String,
  email: String,
  role: String,
  organizationId: ObjectId,
  expiresAt: Date,
  used: Boolean,
});
```

### 3. Add Email Tracking
- Track email opens
- Track link clicks
- Resend if not opened

### 4. Rate Limiting
- Limit invites per admin (prevent spam)
- Max 10 invites per hour
- Max 100 invites per day

### 5. Email Customization
- Allow org admins to customize email template
- Add company logo
- Custom branding colors

## Success Messages

The system provides clear feedback:

**Email Sent Successfully:**
> ✅ Invitation created successfully! An email has been sent to user@example.com with the signup link.

**Email Failed:**
> ⚠️ Invitation created successfully! Email could not be sent. Please share the link manually.

**Invite Accepted:**
> 🎉 Welcome to [Organization]! Your account has been created.
