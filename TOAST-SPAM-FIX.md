# Toast Spam Fix - "Session Expired" Error Loop

## Problem Description

Multiple "Session expired. Please log in again." toast notifications were appearing and stacking up on the screen instead of showing just one and auto-dismissing.

![Toast Spam Issue](image showing 12+ identical error toasts stacked)

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Backend Was Down
- Port 5000 was already in use
- Backend crashed on startup
- All API requests from frontend failed

### 2. Multiple Simultaneous Requests
- Dashboard, Notifications, and other components all loaded simultaneously
- Each component made its own API call
- All requests failed → each triggered a "Session expired" toast
- **Result:** 10+ toasts appeared at once

### 3. No Duplicate Prevention
- Toast system didn't check for duplicate messages
- Every failed request created a new toast
- Same error message repeated many times

### 4. Network Error Not Handled
- Axios interceptor only handled 401 errors
- Network errors (backend down) fell through
- No proper error message for "server unreachable"

### 5. Multiple Refresh Attempts
- Each failed request tried to refresh the token
- All refresh attempts failed simultaneously
- Each failure triggered logout + toast
- **Result:** Cascading failure loop

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added Request Queuing System

**Problem:** Multiple requests refreshing token simultaneously

**Solution:** Queue requests while one refresh is in progress

```javascript
// Track if we're already refreshing
let isRefreshing = false;
let failedQueue = [];

// If already refreshing, queue this request
if (isRefreshing) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    failedQueue.push({ resolve, reject });
  })
  .then((token) => {
    // Retry with new token
    originalRequest.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
    return api(originalRequest);
  });
}
```

**Benefit:** Only ONE refresh attempt happens, others wait for result

---

### 2. Added Network Error Handling

**Problem:** Backend down = no error.response, unhandled error

**Solution:** Detect network errors and return friendly message

```javascript
// Handle network errors (backend down)
if (!error.response) {
  console.error("Network error - backend may be down:", error.message);
  return Promise.reject(
    new Error("Unable to connect to server. Please check your connection.")
  );
}
```

**Benefit:** Clear error message instead of "Session expired"

---

### 3. Added Duplicate Toast Prevention

**Problem:** Same message showing multiple times

**Solution:** Check for duplicates before adding toast

```javascript
const showToast = useCallback((message, type = "info", duration = 3000) => {
  setToasts((prev) => {
    // Check if already exists
    const isDuplicate = prev.some(
      (toast) => toast.message === message && toast.type === type
    );
    
    // Don't add duplicate
    if (isDuplicate) {
      return prev;
    }
    
    const id = toastId++;
    return [...prev, { id, message, type, duration }];
  });
}, []);
```

**Benefit:** Maximum ONE toast per unique message+type combination

---

### 4. Added Logout Guard

**Problem:** Multiple requests all trying to logout simultaneously

**Solution:** Flag to prevent multiple logout attempts

```javascript
// Refresh failed - clear auth and redirect (only once)
if (!window.__logoutInProgress) {
  window.__logoutInProgress = true;
  localStorage.clear();
  
  // Small delay to allow current renders to complete
  setTimeout(() => {
    window.location.href = "/auth";
  }, 100);
}
```

**Benefit:** Logout happens exactly ONCE, not 10+ times

---

### 5. Fixed Backend Startup

**Problem:** Port 5000 already in use

**Solution:** Killed stuck node processes and restarted

```bash
taskkill //F //IM node.exe
node server/server.cjs
```

**Benefit:** Backend now running and accepting requests

---

## Before vs After Comparison

### Before:
```
User loads page
  → 10+ components make API calls
  → Backend is down
  → Each request fails
  → Each tries to refresh token
  → All refresh attempts fail
  → Each triggers logout
  → Each shows "Session expired" toast
  → Result: 12+ identical toasts stacked
```

### After:
```
User loads page
  → 10+ components make API calls
  → Backend is down
  → Network error detected
  → Shows ONE toast: "Unable to connect to server"
  → Duplicate prevention blocks additional toasts
  → Logout happens once
  → Result: 1 toast, clean redirect
```

## Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Backend Down
```
1. Stop backend server
2. Refresh page
3. Should see: ONE toast saying "Unable to connect to server"
4. Should NOT see: Multiple "Session expired" toasts
```

### Test 2: Token Expired
```
1. Backend running
2. Manually expire access token (edit localStorage)
3. Make API request
4. Should see: Automatic token refresh
5. Request should succeed
6. Should NOT see: Any error toasts
```

### Test 3: Refresh Token Expired
```
1. Backend running
2. Remove refresh token cookie
3. Make API request
4. Should see: ONE toast about session expiration
5. Should redirect to login
6. Should NOT see: Multiple toasts
```

### Test 4: Multiple Simultaneous Requests
```
1. Backend running
2. Load dashboard (fetches tasks, projects, notifications)
3. Should see: All requests succeed OR fail gracefully
4. Should NOT see: Multiple identical error toasts
```

## Files Modified

### `src/services/api.js`
- Added request queuing (`isRefreshing`, `failedQueue`)
- Added network error detection
- Added logout guard (`window.__logoutInProgress`)
- Improved error handling

### `src/contexts/ToastContext.jsx`
- Added duplicate toast detection
- Prevents same message+type from showing multiple times

## Configuration

No configuration changes needed. The fixes are automatic.

## Auto-Dismiss Behavior

**Question:** Why do toasts stack up instead of auto-dismissing?

**Answer:** Toasts DO auto-dismiss after 3 seconds! The problem was:
- New toasts were being created faster than old ones dismissed
- 10+ toasts created in < 1 second
- Each dismisses after 3 seconds
- But new ones kept coming
- Net result: Appeared to never dismiss

**With the fix:**
- Only 1 toast for duplicate messages
- Queue system prevents cascading failures
- Toasts properly auto-dismiss
- Clean user experience

## Additional Improvements Made

### 1. Better Error Messages
- Network error: "Unable to connect to server"
- Session expired: "Session expired. Please log in again"
- Generic error: Uses error message from server

### 2. Request Coordination
- Only one token refresh at a time
- Failed requests queued and retried together
- Prevents race conditions

### 3. Graceful Degradation
- Backend down → Clear error message
- Token expired → Automatic refresh
- Refresh failed → Clean logout once

## Production Considerations

### 1. Add Retry Logic
```javascript
// Retry failed requests after short delay
const retryRequest = (request, retries = 3, delay = 1000) => {
  return api(request).catch((error) => {
    if (retries > 0 && !error.response) {
      return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
          resolve(retryRequest(request, retries - 1, delay * 2));
        }, delay);
      });
    }
    throw error;
  });
};
```

### 2. Add Toast Limit
```javascript
// Limit maximum visible toasts
const MAX_TOASTS = 3;

const showToast = useCallback((message, type, duration) => {
  setToasts((prev) => {
    const isDuplicate = prev.some(/*...*/);
    if (isDuplicate) return prev;
    
    // Remove oldest if at limit
    const newToasts = prev.length >= MAX_TOASTS 
      ? prev.slice(1) 
      : prev;
    
    return [...newToasts, { id: toastId++, message, type, duration }];
  });
}, []);
```

### 3. Add Offline Detection
```javascript
window.addEventListener('offline', () => {
  toast.showWarning('You are offline. Some features may not work.');
});

window.addEventListener('online', () => {
  toast.showSuccess('Back online!');
});
```

## Summary

✅ **Fixed:** Multiple identical toasts appearing
✅ **Fixed:** Backend startup issues (port conflict)
✅ **Added:** Duplicate toast prevention
✅ **Added:** Network error handling
✅ **Added:** Request queuing during token refresh
✅ **Added:** Logout guard to prevent multiple redirects

**Result:** Clean, professional error handling with single, auto-dismissing toasts

**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Toast System:** Now production-ready with proper error handling
